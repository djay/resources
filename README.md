BKK/hack Resources
==================

This repository (and mainly [its wiki][wiki]) serves to collect curated
resources for learning popular technologies and programming languages, aimed
especially at self-starters who are using their time at [hack night meetups] to
try something new. There are abundant resources available on the web today, but
particularly as a beginner it can be difficult to know where to start.

This is an endless work-in-progress—new learning aids and languages pop up all
the time, so please contribute your favorites.

If you've got a particular language or technology in mind that you're ready to
learn, head to [the wiki][wiki] and see if we have pointers. If you're brand
new to programming, read on.

General Knowledge
-----------------

Our hack nights attract attendees with a range of skill levels, from seasoned
developers to complete beginners. The resources wiki is organized primarily by
language or subject, which may be most useful if you already know what you're
looking for. This section seeks to give pointers to beginners who may need some
background knowledge before deciding where to go further.

Some language-specific introductory materials are suitable for beginners, like
[Learn Python the Hard Way], but many will assume prior programming experience.
If you're a "top-down", hands-on learner, try resources in the style of the
"Hard Way" series, or interactive online systems like [Treehouse]. If you're
more of a bottom-up learner that likes to understand theory, the online
university course platforms have a great deal of introductory computer science
material available:

  - [Computer Science on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/browse/computer-science?languages=en)
  - [Computer Science on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/subject/computer-science)
  - [Computing on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing)

Language specific:
  - [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) 2-4h/w](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) - aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers
  - [Google Python Course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/?hl=en) - for people with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn Python

Eventually you'll almost certainly want to explore some of the theory and
formal knowledge, but watching lectures might not be the most fun thing to do at
hack nights, unless you recruit some peers to join you :-)

### Practicing the Fundamentals ###

If you've learned some fundamentals and are ready for more practice, there are
several platforms that promote a learn-by-doing approach in a multitude of
languages—if you're ready for some immediate gratification of hands-on coding,
try these:

  - [Exercism](http://exercism.io/)
  - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
  - [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/problems/school)
  - [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/)

This kind of practice can be a more fun fit for the environment of a hack night,
so you may want to try studying background material in advance.
